## Project Name
Challenge Problems - JavaScript
## About
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript coding challenges designed to enhance problem-solving skills and demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript programming. The challenges cover a variety of topics, including loops, string manipulation, array operations, and object-oriented programming, providing practical examples for learning and portfolio development.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Node.js installed on your system to execute JavaScript files via the command line. For the HTML-based challenge, a web browser is required to run the associated JavaScript file. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This project includes these features:

-Implementation of nested loops for pattern generation

-String parsing and numerical operations to find the largest sum of numbers

-Object manipulation to determine mutual friendships and calculate loyalty scores

-Switch-case logic for determining days in a month

-Modular JavaScript files for individual challenge solutions

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/challengeProblems-JavaScript.git`

## Usage
Run the JavaScript scripts from the command line using Node.js. 

For example: 

`node jsDoubleLoops.js`

For the HTML-based challenge, open index.html in a web browser or live server to execute jsQuest.js.


## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master JavaScript fundamentals, including loops, conditionals, and array methods

-Develop algorithmic thinking through diverse coding challenges

-Enhance skills in debugging and optimizing JavaScript code

-Build a portfolio showcasing practical problem-solving abilities
